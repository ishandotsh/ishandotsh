Hi! I'm Ishan
I’ve been in the robotics industry since January 2023. I started out working on navigation and localization of autonomous mobile robots and that was my introduction to SLAM, ICP,
and a host of adjacent algorithms that are standard in the industry. I then spent about 6 months working on robotic arms and finally learned what inverse kinematics really was, what kind of problems you 
face when designing and building user facing interfaces for robots, and a lot about ethercat and motor tuning (not by choice). 

The point is, I’ve faced more problems than I have solved and I think that’s a good thing.
